# MMM-project
Project 16. (RC Phase Shifter).
Model and simulate an RC electrical circuit (see diagram).
Data: resistances R1 and R2, capacitors C1 and C2, external electromotive force U = u(t). Allow the user to define all these parameters in the program menu (positive values).
The description follows from Kirchhoff's laws (voltage and current balances) and Ohm's law: resistor: iRu, capacitor: Ci = du/dt.
The program should plot the current values of the indicated voltages u(t), x1(t), and x2(t). Consider voltage excitation (external electromotive force u(t)) in the form of a step function or a sinusoid.
